          <p>In general, you may visit VideoWiki and access information while not revealing any individual user information other than Technology Related Information (defined below). If you upload content to this Site, the content will be governed by the Terms of Use and any other terms or conditions on the upload pages. The types of individual user information collected in the registration process may include your name, email id, other PII and other information volunteered by you.</p>
          <p>Minions collects PII when you register with VideoWiki, when you visit VideoWiki pages and when you deliver communications or content to VideoWiki.

          <p>Minions will not disclose, transfer, sell or otherwise communicate your PII to any third party, other than Minions' parent, subsidiaries and affiliates, and each of (i) their employees or (ii) vendors and contractors operating under confidentiality agreements and subject to Minions' privacy policy, unless you give Minions permission to do so, except as set forth in this privacy policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary, Minions may disclose any information you provide if required to do so by law or pursuant to a request by law enforcement or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with the legal process; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Minions or third parties; or (3) act in an emergency to protect someone's safety or legal rights ("Mandatory Disclosures"). As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or change our name or form of entity, and, depending upon the transaction, your personal information may be one of the transferred assets; provided, however, we will not sell or transfer PII except subject to the terms of our privacy policy. For instance, in the event that Minions is acquired by another company, your PII may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring party. Minions will notify you before PII about you becomes subject to a different privacy policy. The collected information may be provided in the aggregate to third parties, including potential business partners and advertisers, but this information is not linked to any PII before it is disclosed unless Minions has obtained your consent.</p>
